# Containerized-Airflow-Cluster
Attempt to create an Airflow cluster in containers. Architecture inspired by [inifinitelamba's work](https://www.infinitelambda.com/post/apache-airflow-deployment-on-aws-ecs) and the Saint Louis Regional Data Alliance's [Airflow-Platform](https://github.com/stlrda/Airflow-Platform).
